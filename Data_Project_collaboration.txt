Things I like about Git(hub)

• Create a repository
• Add / Edit files and track changes
• Fork an existing repository
• Make a webpage for your project
• Manage settings and collaborators
• Submit / approve / deny pull requests
• Open / close / track issues
And more! https://lab.github.com/ is a good place to learn all about it.
